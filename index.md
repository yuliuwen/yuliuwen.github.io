<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About</h2>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Luxembourg, where I am a member of the [CLAiM group on Computational Law and Machine Ethics](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/research-groups/computational-law-and-machine-ethics/) led by [Dr. Réka Markovich](https://rekamarkovich.github.io/). 

I am an AI researcher focusing on symbolic and hybrid approaches for human-level and human-centered AI in application areas like digital transformation of law and finance.

### Teaching Profile and Activities
I enjoy **both research-based teaching and foundational teaching**. My research-based teaching focuses on advanced topics in knowledge representation and reasoning, including logic and formal argumentation in AI. Additionally, I contribute to foundational education by coordinating textbook drafting and teaching core subjects in computer science, such as discrete mathematics, propositional logic, and first-order logic.
